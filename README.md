# ward-mess

Welcome on board. Here you find what i have been working on for the past months in the WARD project.

It is mostly code used for importing per minute data, and doing calculations(microevents or similar)

## Beware, here be dragons!

Some works as-is, some requires some adaptation.

Please use what you can, and credit me if you think it is worth it.
